            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I’m John Parrott, a Computer Science graduate from the University of South Florida 
                with a passion for backend development and system architecture. I’m drawn to the logic 
                and structure that power applications behind the scenes, from crafting efficient data 
                models to building reliable APIs that support dynamic user experiences.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Over the past few years, I’ve built projects that emphasize clean design and scalability, 
                including a custom C# web server handling routing, session management, and authentication, 
                as well as a hospital equipment optimization system that uses data analysis to reduce inefficiencies. 
                My work consistently focuses on performance, modularity, and maintainability, principles I carry into every line of code I write.
            </p>
            <p className="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                I’m experienced with tools like Micronaut, PostgreSQL, React, and Docker, and I enjoy connecting the 
                dots between backend logic and frontend interaction. Whether it’s designing algorithms to 
                optimize workflows or integrating database systems into full-stack applications, I find 
                satisfaction in solving complex problems with elegant technical solutions.
            </p>

                Outside of development, you can usually find me on The Rift, OTPing Ekko and 
                occasionally convincing myself my teammates are the problem.
